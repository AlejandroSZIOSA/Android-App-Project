My first Android App

App Name: Pocket Inventory + Shopping Helper 

This is my first Android-App (Developing)

-I created this App using MacOs Monterrey (M1)
-I used Android studio

This app is basically like a “Shopping List” with some extra helpful features. 
The main objective of my App is to save money and time before you go shopping. This app is destined for private use, I mean for one person.
I created this App with the intention to help people have more control over “The Pantry” and “Shopping” , using modern technology techniques. In this case an Android App

If you want see a quick look at my App, you can watch the Demo
If you want see details ,the code so you can contact me (E-post: ggato33@gmail.com)
